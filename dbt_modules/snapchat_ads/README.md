# Snapchat Ads 

This package models Snapchat Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/snapchat-ads). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/snapchat-ads#schemainformation).

The main focus of the package is to transform the core ad object tables into analytics-ready models, including an 'ad adapter' model that can be easily unioned in to other ad platform packages to get a single view.  This is especially easy using our [Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting).

## Models

This package contains transformation models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Snapchat Ads source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_snapchat_ads_source) and our [multi-platform Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting). A dependency on the source package is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. The primary outputs of this package are described below.

| **model**                    | **description**                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| snapchat__ad_adapter         | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each creative, including information about the used UTM parameters. |
| snapchat__account_report     | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each account.                                                       |
| snapchat__campaign_report    | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each campaign.                                                      |
| snapchat__ad_squad_report    | Each record represents the daily ad performance of each ad squad.                                                        |

## Installation Instructions

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration

By default, this package will look for your Snapchat Ads data in the `snapchat_ads` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Snapchat Ads data is, please add the following configuration to your 
`dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    snapchat_schema: your_schema_name
    snapchat_database: your_database_name 
```

For additional configurations for the source models, visit the [Snapchat Ads source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_snapchat_ads_source).

### Changing the Build Schema

By default, this package will build the Snapchat Ads staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_stg_snapchat_ads`) and the final Snapchat Ads models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_snapchat_ads`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled Snapchat data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    snapchat_ads:
        +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
    snapchat_ads_source:
        +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
